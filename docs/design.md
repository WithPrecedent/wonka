Notably, `wonka` is 100% compatible with my other project framework libraries, of which it was originally a part. This is why you should feel confident in the continued development and maintenance of the library - it is essential part of my overall work. I have decided to make it available as a separate library for those that just want to use its implementation without the other components of my project framework ecosystem. So, for example, any of the many registry types of [ashford](https://github.com/WithPrecedent/ashford) can be used with a `Registrar` in `wonka`. Further, for project workflow pipelining, where dynamic factories are essential, the `wonka` classes are interwoven and can be extended in the [chrisjen](https://github.com/WithPrecedent/chrisjen) and [amos](https://github.com/WithPrecedent/amos) packages. Also, for those using configuration option files, `wonka` is supported by the [bobbie](https://github.com/WithPrecedent/bobbie) project settings library. So, I, and any other maintainers, will do my best to promptly integrate any contributions.
